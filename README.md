# THIS UPDATER REQUIRES [POWERSHELL 7](https://github.com/powershell/powershell/releases/latest)

This is a standalone cli-based updater I made to autoupdate my [PolyMC](https://github.com/polymc/polymc) on Windows.

I didn't test this on other machines, use at your own risk.

### Installation:
> Drag both files on PolyMC's root folder.

> You can copy the updater.lnk to wherever u want.
